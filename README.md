# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Analysis


The Heart Disease dataset is a popular dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about individuals, including various medical attributes, and indicates whether they have heart disease or not.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various medical attributes related to heart disease, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, and others. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Number of instances:303
Number of features: 14

## Analysis Summary
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas, and basic information about the data is retrieved.
Descriptive Statistics: Key measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), variability (standard deviation, range), skewness, and kurtosis are calculated.
Data Visualization: Histograms, box plots, and a correlation matrix heatmap are created to visually explore the data.
inferential Statistics: An independent t-test is performed to test if there is a significant difference in maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) between patients with and without heart disease.
